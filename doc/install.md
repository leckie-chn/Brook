# Build Brook Project

Brook can be built on Linux, Mac OS X and FreeBSD, with GCC
(>=4.5.1) or Clang (>=3.0)

Brook depends on the following tools or libraries:

    * [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) is used to manage and build the
      project.
    * [Google Protocal Buffer](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf) is
      used for inter-worker communication and disk storage.
